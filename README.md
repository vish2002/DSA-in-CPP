## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms (DsA) are fundamental concepts in computer science that are essential for building efficient and scalable software solutions. This repository aims to provide implementations of these core concepts in the C++ programming language, making it a valuable resource for students, developers, and anyone interested in learning or practicing DsA.

## Data Structures

### Array ADT

The repository includes an implementation of the Array Abstract Data Type (ADT), which provides operations such as insertion, deletion, and search.

### Array Representations

This section covers different ways of representing arrays, including 1D and 2D arrays.

### Linked List

The repository includes an implementation of the Linked List data structure, which provides a dynamic way of storing and manipulating data.

### Stack

The repository includes an implementation of the Stack data structure, which follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

### Matrices

This section covers the representation and manipulation of matrices in C++.

### Sparse Matrix

The repository includes an implementation of Sparse Matrix, which is a matrix representation that stores only the non-zero elements.

### Trees

The repository includes an implementation of various tree data structures, such as Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees.

## Algorithms

### Recursion

This section includes examples of recursive algorithms and their implementation in C++.

### Graphs

The repository includes implementations of graph algorithms, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

## Usage

To use the implementations in this repository, you can clone the repository and navigate to the respective directories. Each data structure and algorithm has a README file that explains how to use the implementation.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-in-cpp.git
cd dsa-in-cpp
